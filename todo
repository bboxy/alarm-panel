add sds support
add watchdog and visualize if alarmmon is still running (->needs to update a separate timestamp that is checked by the browser? -> check timestamp functions in .js)
either use lat/long or adress for geocoder, test, prefer gps over adress, adress only fallback
base lat/long coords: extract from config and set in script.js
